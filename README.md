This repository hosts key components and procedures from my Cloud Security capstone projects, which include a HIPAA-compliant application deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and a PCI-DSS-compliant application deployed on Microsoft Azure. The repository serves as a reference for the work I have done and is intended for recruiters, colleagues, and anyone interested in understanding the technical implementation of these compliance-focused projects.

## Projects Overview

### 1. HIPAA-Compliant Application on GCP

- **Objective**: Ensure compliance with HIPAA standards for protecting healthcare data.
- **Architecture**: Deployed using a 3-tier architecture.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Frontend and Backend Subnets**: Separated into different Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) to enhance security.
  - **Database**: Managed MySQL instance with VPC peering to ensure secure data flow.
  - **Security**: Firewalls, secure access, and data encryption to protect sensitive information.

### 2\. PCI-DSS-Compliant Application on Azure

- **Objective**: Ensure compliance with PCI-DSS standards to secure payment information.
- **Architecture**: Multi-layered setup with stringent security measures.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Networking**: Virtual Networks (VNets) with subnet isolation for critical components.
  - **Security**: Network Security Groups (NSGs), encryption, and Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to secure data and control access.

## Key Features

- **Automated Infrastructure Deployment**: Bash scripts for provisioning Virtual Machines (VMs) in both GCP and Azure environments.
- **Compliance-Driven Configurations**: Secure configurations tailored to meet compliance requirements, focusing on data protection, encryption, and secure access controls.

## Required 3 safeguards of the HIPAA Security Rule

- 1. Physical safeguards for ePHI
- 2. Technical safeguards for ePHI
- 3. Administrative safeguards for ePHI

## How to Use

1.  **Provisioning Scripts**: Located in the `provisioning-scripts` folder under each project directory, these Bash scripts automate the setup of virtual machines and security configurations.
2.  **Application Source Code**: Available under the `app/src` directories, providing the actual codebase of the deployed applications.

## Getting Started

- Create VPCs
  - Add necessary subnets
- Provision virtual machines:
  - ssh into virtual machine instance
- Create deployment script file
  - nano script_name.sh
  - Copy and paste corresponding script from well named folders and save
  - Make script executable and run the script
- Edit configuration files
- Start the application

## Important Notes

- **Sensitive Information**: Ensure to replace any sensitive data or keys in the scripts with appropriate placeholders before use.
- **Compliance**: Configurations are tailored to meet specific compliance requirements; review and adapt according to your specific needs.
